In this post, I plan to keep a record on my learning path of Python moving from research code to semi-production code.

Research code: currently, I often write "research code" as a tool to prove/test/verify some concepts, w/o taking into account formal/conventional practice
of the specific coding language used. Thus, the code is often not carefully designed for efficient implementations. 

As time goes on, I realized the importance of modular code design and want to incorporate more software engineering practices
when writing code. 

The aim of this post is for future references and hopefully can also gather some information for people who have similar interests. Feel free to reach out if you know some good reference/resources. Thanks!
